## Introduction

This research project adapts several self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques with Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoders to the domain of seizure detection. This work is part of an ongoing collaborative effort with the Neural Signal & Brain Processing Lab at the [Krembil Research Institute](https://www.uhn.ca/Krembil). The objective is to train a GNN encoder and then evaluate its performance downstream on seizure detection with the following SSL methods: Relative Positioning, Temporal Shuffling, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), and Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg). The GNN architecture comprises of Edge-Conditioned Convolution (ECC) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers, utilizing PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric libraries for standard deep learning and GNN implementation. For a more detailed description of our research, see [projects/ssl-seizure-detection](https://www.xaviermootoo.com/projects/ssl-seizure-detection).

## Data
Processed data formatted as PyTorch Geometric Data objects is not yet available for release but will be provided once the paper is released. Meanwhile, the initial intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) dataset utilized for this project is publicly accessible on OpenNeuro, identified by Accession Number [ds003029](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003029/versions/1.0.6). From ds003029, we selected 26 patients out of the 88 available in the dataset. For each patient iEEG signal, we divided the signal into time windows of equal length, and for each window an initial graph representation was constructed with the following method. The initial graph representations are fully connected graphs, with the nodes corresponding to individual electrodes. To construct the edge features, for each electrode pair, we computed the Pearson correlation, phase-lock value (PLV), and the coherence, giving us edge features of dimension 3. To construct the node features, we used the average energy of the electrode, and the average energies at various frequency bands; due to variability in the iEEG data format, there may have been more or less frequency bands available for certain patients, thus node features dimensions varied between $7-9$ (dependent on the patient). From this, we converted the data to the standard [PyTorch Geometric Data format](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.data.Data.html#torch_geometric.data.Data) of `[edge_index, x, edge_attr, y]` where `edge_index` is a tensor defining the graph structure (similar to a binary adjacency matrix), `x` is the node feature tensor, `edge_attr` is the edge feature tensor, and `y` is the target label tensor taking on values $0$ or $1$ for binary classification of ictal (seizure) or nonictal (no seizure); and took on values $0,1,$ or $2$ for preictal (before seizure), ictal (seizure), and postictal (after seizure) respectively for multiclass classification. Due of the heterogeneity of the iEEG data from patient to patient (e.g., different number of electrodes, different placement of electrodes) model training and evaluation was conducted intra-patient, thus a separate model was created for each patient.


## Usage
To run the entire pipeline, please refer to the `train()` function in [`train.py`](/src/train.py) and the relevant docstring. Please see the notebook [`train.ipynb`](/notebooks/train.ipynb) for guidance on how to train each model. The [`main.py`](/src/main.py) script is optimized for HPC on the Cledar cluster (Digital Research Alliance of Canada), and is not recommended for general use. For a tutorial on PyTorch Geometric and customized GNN models, please refer to [`tutorial.ipynb`](/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb). To see how the initial graph representations are created, please refer to [`preprocess.ipynb`](/notebooks/preprocess.ipynb). For a information on the transfer learning process (implemented in [`train.py`](/src/train.py)), please refer to [`transfer.ipynb`](/notebooks/transfer.ipynb).
